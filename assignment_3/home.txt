My name is Tom Forde. I am a 2nd year Psychology and Computing student at UCC. This website is for assignment 2 of my Web Develpment module.
  In this assignment I created a navigation bar that stays at the top of the page as you scroll.
  I used CSS flexbox to space the elements in the navbar evenly and allow them to be responsive to window resizing.
  I have included two timetables - one for lectures and one for labs.
  I have also included two photo sections - one of my hometown Cork and another of the Sheep's Head peninsula.
